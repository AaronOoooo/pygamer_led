# pygamer_led# üéÆ PyGamer LED Controller

This project turns your [Adafruit PyGamer](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4242) into a colorful handheld controller for a WS2811-based addressable LED strip.

With only 4 built-in buttons, you can cycle through 11 stunning LED effects, pause animations, and toggle LEDs on and off. The display shows the current or upcoming effect name, making it intuitive and fun to use.

## üß∞ Hardware Required

| Item                                                      | Description                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| [Adafruit PyGamer](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4242) | Microcontroller + display + buttons |
| WS2811 LED strip (30 LEDs)                                | Addressable RGB LEDs                |
| JST SM 3-pin cable or jumper wires                        | To connect Data, GND, and 5V        |
| Optional: External power supply                           | Needed if using more than \~30 LEDs |

## üîå Wiring

| LED Wire | Connect To                     |
| -------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Data** | `D3` on PyGamer (JST Port 2)   |
| **GND**  | `GND`                          |
| **5V**   | `VOUT` (for short strips only) |

> Note: The PyGamer can power short LED strips directly. For larger setups, use a separate 5V power supply and common ground.
